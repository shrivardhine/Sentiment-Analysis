Sentiment analysis

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of tweets related to airlines using a deep learning approach. The script employs an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model, implemented with Keras, to classify tweets as having either positive or negative sentiment. By processing and analyzing the text data, the model can predict the sentiment of new tweets, helping to understand customer opinions and feedback in the aviation industry.
